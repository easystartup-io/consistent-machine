# My journey to vim

I have been using vim motions for a good few years now. Had learnt it slightly in college and then spent 2-3 hours before joining my first job, learning it properly. And that has been the best 2-3 hours investment I have put in my life. I use IntelliJ for my job and use VS code for my side projects.

I have been using the built in vim plugin on these editors and it has been good. But I wanted to try out neovim and see how it is. I have heard a lot of good things about it. So I decided to give it a try. So I uninstalled VS code and switched to vim completely.

## My experience using neovim

Have been using it since the last two weeks and I absolutely love it. Love how customisable it is, it allows me to set and do everything, feels so lightweight and fast too. Also I have integrated Github Copilot and it has'nt disappointed me yet. I have been using it for my side projects and it has been amazing. Havent faced any issues yet. Also haven't switched back to VS code yet.

I have configured the javscript lsp with a theme of my choosing. catpuccin-latte . Yes I do like light mode.

Along with it I have installed oh-my-zsh and power 100k plugins for my iterm2 terminal and I feel this is the best setup I have ever had. I had to use vs code before but it always felt a bit off and never satisfied. That is why I think I feel so much better using neo vim because it makes me fell very powerful and satisfied and allows me to do anything and doesn't come in my way of doing work that matters. Best thing to do . 100% Would recommend people go for it, dont switch directly if you haven't used vim before, start with using vim motions in your current IDE then gradually once you feel comfortable you can explore neovim with lazyvim setup, lightweight and super powerful and customisable. I still use IntelliJ for Java, but for web development, I am all in for neovim.

:::tip Some commands which are must to switch to neovim with lazyvim setup

* space + space -> this will open a popup with files you can search in your project (find_files basically)
* space + / -> this will open a popup with files you can do inside file search in your project (find usage in any file in project)
* gr -> jump to reference (This will require that the right LSP is installed)
* gd -> jump to definition (This will require that the right LSP is installed)
